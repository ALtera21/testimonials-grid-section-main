## Overview

I would never underestimated flex based challenge ever again

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
(i had only ONE job, and i can't do it cleanly)

## My process

I just wasted 5 WHOLE DAMN HOURS just to make the question mark right, resizing the text, and fixing the mobile version.
I did the usual, made the container, made the layout, made a layout inside the layout so that i can pad all of them and inserted all the content inside the second layout that is inside the first layout.

3 hours wasted just on the mobile version to made sure that some content won't cut off the screen, ALL BECAUSE OF A DAMN QUOTATION MARK, THE MARK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FIRST TESTIMONY BUT THE SIZE OF THE MARK MADE IT BREACH OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND I WAS WONDERING WHY THE HELL DID THE SCREEN LOOSES UP

i should've check it using inspect before this disaster happened, and now it's too late, 3 hours now gone without doing anything useful to the code .

### Built with

- div is better, no semantic for this challenge
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- no library or framework

### What I learned

I struggled to put the quotation mark on the purple testimonial card, and i only found out about how to do it by accident, i don't know that absolut could stack on top of each other, now i know

### Continued development

I must do it cleanly on the next challenge

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I think everyone should know how to use this website, it is like wikipedia made only for coding
- [getcssscan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - i used this website to copypaste the shadow style
